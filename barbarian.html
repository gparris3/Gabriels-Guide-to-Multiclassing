    <h2>Notable Features</h2>
    <h3>Rage</h3>
    <p>
        Barbarian's signature. Hit harder. Tank better. No concentration on spells and no casting spells, and ends if you don't attack, force a saving throw, or use a Bonus Action to extend it. So, never, if you're using it properly.
    </p>
    <h3>Unarmored Defense</h3>
    <p>
        Changes your base AC to 10+DEX+CON. Unlike Monk, you can still use a shield.
    </p>
    <h3>Reckless Attack</h3>
    <p>
        Advantage on Strength attack rolls until the start of your next turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage.
    </p>
    <h2>Possible Combinations</h2>
    <details><summary>Bard</summary>
    <p>
        An effective all-rounder, supplementing Barbarian's hyperfocus on combat with Bard's everything else. Alternatively, if you can plan ahead, advantage on your rolls and disadvantage on your enemies' can lead to very effective grappling.
    </p>
    </details>
    <details>
    <summary>Cleric</summary>
    <p>
        War domain grants some useful options, but otherwise just not worth it.
    </p>
    </details>
    <details>
    <summary>Druid</summary>
    <p>
        Can create fun roleplay potential through combining Wild Shape with Rage or Form of the Beast, but otherwise can end up holding you back.
    </p>
    </details>
    <details>
    <summary>Fighter</summary>
    <p>
        Rage and Reckless Attack combine very well with Champion, as rolling a critical hit is much easier, and crits you do will will hit much harder. 
    </p>
    </details>
    <details>
    <summary>Monk</summary>
    <p>
        Complex and requires planning to really work. You have to juggle 4 different ability scores for extra attack options and unarmored defense that doesn't stack. Your movement will be great, if you can pull it off, with a free +10 at 5th level Barbarian.
    </p>
    </details>
    <details>
    <summary>Paladin</summary>
    <p>
        Beg to let your DM use the 2014 version of Paladin. Divine Smite isn't a spell there. Otherwise, a lot of synergies that never were.
    </p>
    </details>
    <details>
    <summary>Ranger</summary>
    <p>
        Another Fighting Style and some spellcasting. Not that you'll get to use the latter in combat with Rage. Not too great.
    </p>
    </details>
    <details>
    <summary>Rogue</summary>
    <p>
        If you get creative, Assassin can work well with the guaranteed critical hits on surprised enemies. Doesn't conflict with Rage or Unarmored Defense, though you'll be capping your output if you fail with Sneak Attack's light/finesse limitation. You could easily solve this by carrying around a spare, however. If you dip far into it, Uncanny Dodge can make you even tankier, but you'll get diminishing returns before then.
    </p>
    </details>
    <details>
    <summary>Sorcerer</summary>
    <p>
        Pointless. Full spellcasting focus with a class that can't use it most of the time.
    </p>
    </details>
    <details>
    <summary>Warlock</summary>
    <p>
        There are some features outside of spellcasting you can use, especially if you pick up Hexblade, but there isn't enough synnergy here to really go for it.
    </p>
    </details>
    <details>
    <summary>Wizard</summary>
    <p>
        Same as Sorcerer. Can't cast in Rage.
    </p>
    </details>
    <h2>Closing Notes</h2>
    <p>
        There are some classes that synnergize well with Barbarian, but a lot of the time Rage's restriction on spellcasting makes the combination much worse than just staying with Barbarian. Stick with the martial classes.
