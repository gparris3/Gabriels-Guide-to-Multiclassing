            <h2>Notable Features</h2>
            <h3>Sneak Attack</h3>
            <p>
                Starts fairly small, but commit to Rogue and you can easily rival Fighter DPS.
            </p>
            <h3>Expertise</h3>
            <p>
                Look your DM in the eye and ask if a 40 passes. Add your proficiency bonus a second time. This gets very
                absurd combined with Reliable Talent at 7th level.
            </p>
            <h3>Reliable Talent</h3>
            <p>
                If you roll below a 10 in a skill you're proficient in, treat the roll as a 10. If you have expertise
                and a decent score, will save plenty of time not bothering with the dice.
            </p>
            <h2>Possible Combinations</h2>
            <details>
                <summary>Barbarian</summary>
                <p>
                    A few levels of Barbarian can compliment Rogue well. Reckless Attack creates free advantage
                    opportunities without giving up movement for Steady Aim, and Uncanny Dodge can counteract the risk
                    of it. Unarmored Defense can also work wonders for Rogue, not to mention the Constitution bonus to
                    use it well.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Bard</summary>
                <p>
                    Never fail a skill check again. Pick up Jack Of All Trades and maybe Swashbuckler to put that
                    Charisma modifier to work. Spellcasting can definitely give Rogue room to work with as well.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Cleric</summary>
                <p>
                    Nothing Rogue really wants. At most, you want Spellcasting, and there are better options to go about
                    getting it.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Druid</summary>
                <p>
                    I can see the vision with Wild Shape, but in practice you can probably stealth as straight Rogue
                    better than a fly.
                </p>

                <summary>Fighter</summary>
                <p>
                    Very silly. Take Battle Master and Swashbuckler. See, Sneak Attack only specifies per turn, not per
                    round. One sneak attack on your action, one with Action Surge, and one on reaction with Riposte.
                    Swashbuckler means you don't need Advantage or allies nearby if you're in a 1 on 1. The higher Hit
                    Die and Second Wind can also work wonders for your survivability. Medium Armor could work at lower
                    levels, but your Dexterity should be above 2 very quickly and Medium Armor Master is a poor
                    investement when you want to take Dexterity higher than 3 anyway.
                </p>

                <summary>Monk</summary>
                <p>
                    Tempting, but too much of a commitment. Takes too many levels to be worth. Works better with Monk as
                    the main class and a small dip into Rogue.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Paladin</summary>
                <p>
                    In theory, a critical hit that will tear your foes asunder singlehandedly. In practice, a Rogue that
                    has to choose to use some of their Sneak Attack dice.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Ranger</summary>
                <p>
                    A very timeless combo. Hunter's Mark, a Fighting Style, more stealth related abilities with
                    Gloomstalker, and spellcasting to round out the build.
                </p>

            <details>
                <summary>Sorcerer</summary>
                <p>
                    Some decent options, though it's a tossup whether it's better than sticking with Rogue. In 2014 it
                    was an easy 1-level dip for Draconic Bloodline, but now it takes a while to kick in. Shield and the
                    like make you hard to hit, though.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Warlock</summary>
                <p>
                    A Hexblade Warlock is an excellent combo for rogues. Take the Devil's Sight incantation to see in
                    magical darkness. The same darkness that you yourself can cast. Free advantage, lots of Sneak
                    Attack, and if you can convince your DM, take Assassin for free critical hits with Assassinate.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Wizard</summary>
                <p>
                    Bladesinger wizard combos well for extra AC and spellcasting. If you're feeling funny, use Find
                    Familiar and have it use the Help action for free Advantage whenever you choose.
                </p>
            </details>
            <h2>Closing Notes</h2>
            <p>
                There are some builds that the Rogue doesn't want, but there are plenty more that can work well. Several
                classes either cover Rogue's weaknesses or augment its strengths.
