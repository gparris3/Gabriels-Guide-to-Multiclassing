            <h2>Notable Features</h2>
            <h3>Favored Enemy</h3>
            <p>
                Hunter's Mark is a useful spell, and you can cast it for free twice (or more depending on your level)
                per long rest. It's always prepared as well, freeing up your chosen spells for other options as well.
            </p>
            <h3>Spellcasting</h3>
            <p>
                Ranger has some good exclusive spells, but even aside from those more slots to work with is always a
                helpful addition.
            </p>
            <h2>Possible Combinations</h2>
            <details>
                <summary>Barbarian</summary>
                <p>
                    I can see the vision roleplay-wise, but in practice some features clash, like Rage restricting your
                    spellcasting.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Bard</summary>
                <p>
                    No real synnergies here. Lots of utility, I suppose.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Cleric</summary>
                <p>
                    Primarily Ranger. Take Archery. Bless will give you a bonus to hit along with supporting others, as well
                    as supporting your Constitution saves. Certain combinations like Hunter ranger and War cleric can get
                    several attacks early on.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Druid</summary>
                <p>
                    Redundant. If inspiration strikes, Gloomstalker ranger and Spores druid could have potential, but Druid
                    doesn't multiclass well thanks to Wild Shape. Just don't use Circle of the Moon.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Fighter</summary>
                <p>
                    An easy way to shift Ranger into a more melee-focused build. Heavy armor, more proficiencies and weapon
                    masteries,
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Monk</summary>
                <p>
                    Unarmored defense is good, and the extra Wisdom to get use out of Focus and Unarmored Defense will also
                    boost your casting. An unusual direction to take Ranger in, but an interesting one.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Paladin</summary>
                <p>
                    Two half-casters unfortunately do not make a full martial and full caster. Prerequisites spread your
                    stats thin, but if you make it past those then their subclasses can synergize well, and both of their
                    targeting features can combine for a powerful melee turn.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Rogue</summary>
                <p>
                    A very timeless combo. Hunter's Mark, a Fighting Style, more stealth related abilities with
                    Gloomstalker, and spellcasting to round out some of Rogue's weak points.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Sorcerer</summary>
                <p>
                    Very little synergy here, with Ranger focusing on DEX and WIS while Sorcerers focus on CHA your scores
                    spread thin. 2014 Hunter Ranger's Horde Breaker used to provide some synergy to work with melee spells,
                    but 2024 reworded this to no longer work.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Warlock</summary>
                <p>
                    There is potential here, but it does require a specific goal in mind. Darkness and Devil's Sight can
                    synergize well with Gloom Stalker Ranger, and a lot of Ranger's spells don't really need WIS. It has its
                    niche, if you're set on the combo.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Wizard</summary>
                <p>
                    No real synergy. Splits ability scores for less return than it's worth.
                </p>
            </details>
            <h2>Closing Notes</h2>
            <p>
                While it doesn't apply everywhere, when Ranger does synergize with a class it provides useful skills to
                round out some more focused classes.
