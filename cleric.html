    <h2><img src="Cleric.jpg" height="40" width="40" class="classicon">The Cleric Class</h2>
    <p>Some people see Cleric as the healer/support class. This is untrue. They're <i>capable</i> of healing and support, and they're too busy babysitting the party to follow up on their true potential. A cleric left unchecked can very well scorch the earth.</p>

    <h2>Notable Features</h2>
    <h3>Spellcasting</h3>
    <p>
        Cleric has access to powerful spells. Toll the Dead, Inflict Wounds, and Guiding Bolt are all amazing, and you get them with a single level here, as opposed to other classes needing a subclass to get their hands on these spells.
    </p>
    <h3>Channel Divinity</h3>
    <p>
        Your more diverse options are going to come from multiclassing, so it's hard to give a general statement, but good options that you can use a decent handful of times.
    </p>
    <h2>Possible Combinations</h2>
    <h3>Barbarian</h3>
    <p>
        Some combinations can give useful options, but most of the features you get at early levels aren't too useful, and dedicating too many handicaps you heavily.
    </p>
    <h3>Bard</h3>
    <p>
        Doubles down on support, but you have to juggle both WIS and CHA. Lore Bard can use Magical Secrets to get spells that Life Cleric wouldn't normally be able to access like Healing Spirit and apply its healing buff to those as well.
    </p>
    <h3>Druid</h3>
    <p>
        They both use the same spellcasting modifier so a dip of a few levels can be very useful for Cleric. However, some DMS rule that Druids cannot use metal, which will be a problem with your armor.
    </p>
    <h3>Fighter</h3>
    <p>
        "We have Paladin at home," they said. War domain compliments Fighter well, though there are some feature overlaps. Even so, you can make weapon attacks as a Bonus Action and give yourself a +10 to hit bonus. Combined with Action Surge and a few extra attacks, you're all but guaranteed to hit.
    </p>
    <h3>Monk</h3>
    <p>
        Unarmored Defense and Martial Arts can be solid choices for martial-focused clerics like Grave and Light domains. War domain gets redundant with its second attack, but otherwise holds solid. With good Dexterity and Wisdom, a solid option. You also don't rely on War Caster or weapon juggling.
    </p>
    <h3>Paladin</h3>
    <p>
        It can work, with Paladin offering Divine Smite and Cleric offering better spell progression, but juggling 4 ability scores will often ruin the build's effectiveness.
    </p>
    <h3>Ranger</h3>
    <p>
        Primarily Ranger. Take Archery. Bless will give you a bonus to hit along with supporting others, as well as supporting your Constitution saves. Certain combinations like Hunter ranger and War cleric can get several attacks early on.
    </p>
    <h3>Rogue</h3>
    <p>
        Rogue doesn't offer anything Cleric really needs. If you really want the utility, pick Bard. If you must, make sure to use Trickery cleric so the proficiencies mesh well.
    </p>
    <h3>Sorcerer</h3>
    <p>
        Divine Soul Sorcerer and Order cleric can mesh well. Strong support caster, works well to pump up your martial party members.
    </p>
    <h3>Warlock</h3>
    <p>
        Fun roleplay, tricky combat. Life cleric and Celestial warlock can mesh fair enough, if you want to try this combo.
    </p>
    <h3>Wizard</h3>
    <p>
        Access to some of the best spells in the game on both sides, but tricky to balance. Plus, you miss out on higher level spells, which may make the idea in question moot.
    </p>
    <h2>Closing Notes</h2>
    <p>
        Cleric has a few strong combos, but it can work on its own well enough to not really need multiclassing. Most effective builds will pump up something specific to get results.
