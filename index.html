    <h2>Welcome to Gabriel's Guide to Multiclassing</h2>
    <p>Throughout all my years playing Dungeons and Dragons, I've yet to find a site that gives a proper guide to their multiclassing. There are blog posts aplenty, sure, but none dedicate a proper site to it, resulting in pages that just feel cramped. With this site, I strive to fix that.</p>
    <h3>What is multiclassing?</h3>
    <p>
        Multiclassing is when you take levels in multiple classes instead of sticking to one in particular. This allows for more flexibility in your playstyle. For example, a fighter that wants to get spellcasting could take the Eldritch Knight subclass, but this means they miss out on subclass features, and even then get horribly slow spell level scaling. Instead, they could multiclass into Warlock, and not only get almost twice the scaling speed, but access to all of Warlock's features, like eldritch invocations and the phenomenal eldritch blast cantrip.
    </p>
    <h3>Why Need a Guide?</h3>
    <p>
        Not all classes are created equal. There are many classes that work on the assumption that you stick with them until level 20, such as Monk. These classes require far more planning to avoid falling off. Specific subclasses are sometimes mandatory to avoid becoming dead weight for your party. Multiclassing is fun, but Dungeon and Dragons is a team game, and when your fun starts to be a drawback on the team, it wears on their fun as well.
