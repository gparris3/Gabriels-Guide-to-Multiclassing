    <p>Unarmed strikes and Focus points to augment them. Similar to rogue, hit, don't get hit, and get out, but with far more focus on the skirmisher nature.</p>

    <h2>Notable Features</h2>
    <h3>Unarmored Defense</h3>
    <!-- Placeholder text. Nothing in the rubric actually mentions that I need my final text now, and I want to make sure I have the designs set first. If this is still here, I ran into time constraints. -->
    <p>
        Sets your unarmored AC to 10 + DEX + WIS.
    </p>
    <h3>Martial Arts</h3>
    <p>
        If you're using unarmed strikes, simple weapons, or martial weapons with the Light property, you can make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, use a d6 (or higher, depending on monk level) as your damage dice, and use Dexterity in place of Strength.
    </p>
    <h2>Possible Combinations</h2>
    <details>
        <summary>Barbarian</summary>
        <p>
            Complex and requires planning to really work. You have to juggle 4 different ability scores for extra attack options and unarmored defense that doesn't stack. Your movement will be great, if you can pull it off, with a free +10 at 5th level Barbarian..
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Bard</summary>
        <p>
            Works surprisingly well. Way of the Drunken Master's text description often uses dancers and performers alongside drunkards, so its flavoring can easily be narrowed down. This already matches Bard, and things like College of Swords can push this further as their martial and melee weapons can be used as a spellcasting focus, and their maneuvers can compliment Monk's dip in, dip out nature.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Cleric</summary>
        <p>
            Unarmored Defense and Martial Arts can be solid choices for martial-focused clerics like Grave and Light domains. War domain gets redundant with its second attack, but otherwise holds solid. With good Dexterity and Wisdom, a solid option. You also don't rely on War Caster or weapon juggling.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Druid</summary>
        <p>
            A fun option for roleplay, and can work decently well in practice. Can synergize well with Circle of Spores with its higher potential AC and extra attack for its poison.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Fighter</summary>
        <p>
            A very difficult combination. On paper it can seem tempting for Extra Attack, Second Wind and Fighting Styles, but in practice the dexterity half of Fighter doesn't work properly with Monk. You're restricted from armor and most weapons, making your Fighter proficiencies useless. It can be a menace at early levels though, as the Unarmed Fighting Style gets you a very early d8 unarmed strike, normally only accessible at 11th level Monk.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Paladin</summary>
        <p>
            No smite on unarmed strikes, no armor, and 4 scores to juggle. Not worth.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Ranger</summary>
        <p>
            Takes a while to kick in, but taking Kensei for longbow and longsword use can make it work. Hunter's Mark and Flurry of Blows work well together as well.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Rogue</summary>
        <p>
            Shadow Monks dipping into rogue gives a lot of effective features. Daggers and shortswords can easily net you Sneak Attack as well. Cunning Action also gets you some bonus actions that won't cost you a ki point.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Sorcerer</summary>
        <p>
            No synergy. Anything Sorcerer will give monk in close range is offset by the levels burnt to get it.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Warlock</summary>
        <p>
            Hex, Hexblade's Curse, and Invocations can be good additions to Monk. They also both regain essential features on a short rest. Higher levels can begin to fall off, though.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Wizard</summary>
        <p>
            No synergy. Wizard doesn't offer anything to Monk's martial arts, and Monk hampers Wizard's spellcasting.
        </p>
    </details>
    <h2>Closing Notes</h2>
    <p>
        Monk doesn't multiclass particularly well, but some classes can benefit greatly from Martial Arts if they play their cards right. It's also an easy dip for Unarmored Defense.
