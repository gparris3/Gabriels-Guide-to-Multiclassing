    <h2>Notable Features</h2>
    <h3>Wild Shape</h3>
    <p>
        You can transform into assorted animals based on Druid level, more if you choose Circle of the Moon..
    </p>
    <h2>Possible Combinations</h2>
    <details>
        <summary>Barbarian</summary>
        <p>
            Can create fun roleplay potential through combining Wild Shape with Rage or Form of the Beast, but otherwise can end up holding you back.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Bard</summary>
        <p>
            Buffs and summons and battlefield control, all in a single character. You need to juggle WIS and CHA, but it can work well with some planning.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Cleric</summary>
        <p>
            They both use the same spellcasting modifier so a dip of a few levels can be very useful for Druid, as Cleric's cantrips are generally more damaging. However, don't stick with the class too long, as higher level spells end up redundant.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Fighter</summary>
        <p>
            Champion fighter can work well here, as the extended crit range applies to natural weapons. Dreams druid and Echo Knight fighter could also mesh well on the lore side of things: a manifestation of your dream self.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Monk</summary>
        <p>
            A good single-level option to get Unarmored Defense, and can synergize well with Circle of Spores with its higher potential AC and extra attack for its poison.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Paladin</summary>
        <p>
            Divine Smite and Fighting Styles are a good option for Circle of Spores and maybe Moon, and auras work while in Wild Shape. However, getting these puts you far behind on Wild Shape, and likely won't be worth it.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Ranger</summary>
        <p>
            Redundant. If inspiration strikes, Gloomstalker ranger and Spores druid could have potential, but Druid doesn't multiclass well thanks to Wild Shape. Just don't use Circle of the Moon.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Rogue</summary>
        <p>
            Rogue doesn't really have anything Druid needs. Sneak Attack won't be particularly useful, and for proficiencies you're better off picking up Bard.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Sorcerer</summary>
        <p>
            Just take Metamagic Adept.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Warlock</summary>
        <p>
            Just take Circle of the Land or Eldritch Adept.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Wizard</summary>
        <p>
            Decent enough with the focus on spellcasting if you can juggle the extra score. Though, as usual, Wild Shape is too important to druid to justify the levels.
        </p>
    </details>
    <h2>Closing Notes</h2>
    <p>
        Most classes simply aren't worth the commitment. Wild Shape is an important feature for Druid, so any class that isn't dip-friendly often won't see much return on investment.
