    <h2>Notable Features</h2>
    <h3>Font of Magic</h3>
    <p>
        Sorcery points are what make sorcerers so flexible, able to create extra spell slots or use them to empower spells through metamagic. Additionally, these are not limited to sorcerer spell slots, and apply across all classes.
    </p>
    <h3>Metamagic</h3>
    <p>
        Metamagic allows for several different options to alter your casted spells, such as getting to reroll a spell with Empowered Spell, or reducing your spells to a bonus action with Quickened Spell.
    </p>
    <h2>Possible Combinations</h2>
    <h3>Barbarian</h3>
    <p>
        Pointless. Full spellcasting focus with a class that can't use it most of the time.
    </p>
    <h3>Bard</h3>
    <p>
        A good choice to pump up Bard's spellcasting. No alternating ability scores, so a simple choice if you want a slightly more passive role in combat.
    </p>
    <h3>Cleric</h3>
    <p>
        Divine Soul Sorcerer and Order cleric can mesh well. Strong support caster, works well to pump up your martial party members.
    </p>
    <h3>Druid</h3>
    <p>
        Just take Magic Initiate.
    </p>
    <h3>Fighter</h3>
    <p>
        Action Surge is always nice. Some of Sorcerer's big features come early on, and Action Surge makes Quickened Spell redundant to take other metamagic options. Or take it anyway, maybe even dipping Warlock as well for Eldritch Blast to <i>really</i> get silly.
    </p>
    <h3>Monk</h3>
    <p>
        No synergy. Sorcerer and Monk don't provide anything for each other.
    </p>
    <h3>Paladin</h3>
    <p>
        Even just a single level of Sorcerer will get you cantrips and plenty of spell slots to funnel into your smites. Draconic Bloodline can even get you a Dexterity-based build through Draconic Resilience. Metamagic can complement some Paladin spells well, but most slots will likely funnel into smiting. This is a rare case of smites changing to a spell benefits, as you can use Metamagic on your smites now (if it's worth the cost in More Smites).
    </p>
    <h3>Ranger</h3>
    <p>
        Very little synergy here, with Ranger focusing on DEX and WIS while Sorcerers focus on CHA your scores spread thin. 2014 Hunter Ranger's Horde Breaker used to provide some synergy to work with melee spells, but 2024 reworded this to no longer work.
    </p>
    <h3>Rogue</h3>
    <p>
        Shadow Magic sorcerer fits thematically, but it also grants you great darkness related features to farm Sneak Attack and maneuver around the battlefield.
    </p>
    <h3>Warlock</h3>
    <p>
        Your DM will hate you. An infamous multiclass for one specific reason: a strategy dubbed CoffeeLock. Luckily, this was worked around in the 2024 ruleset, but previously there was a loophole which allowed you to farm sorcery points limitlessly. Still a powerful combination today, as you still regain your Warlock spells on a short rest, which you can funnel into sorcery points for incredible longevity and versatility.
    </p>
    <h3>Wizard</h3>
    <p>
        Tempting, but redundant. The different stats diminish effectiveness for too similar of features. A dip can be argued for, but there's a certain point of similarity where you just stick with the first class.
    </p>
    <h2>Closing Notes</h2>
    <p>
        Metamagic and Font of Magic are very powerful features, offering great additions to casters while still holding its own enough to benefit martials.
