            <h2>Notable Features</h2>
            <h3>Eldritch Invocations</h3>
            <p>
                Powerful options, though most are locked behind having a certain amount of Warlock levels. Great choices
                include Pact of the Blade, Eldritch Sight, and Agonizing Blast. Though, naturally, these will change
                with the build you're going for.
            </p>
            <h3>Pact Magic</h3>
            <p>
                Though not as powerful as it was in the 2014 version, Warlocks still have the same general mindset.
                Powerful spells, but you can't use them often. In exchange. you get them back on a short rest as well as
                a long rest and have some great cantrips to choose from as well.
            </p>
            <h2>Possible Combinations</h2>
            <details>
                <summary>Barbarian</summary>
                <p>
                    Doesn't synergize too well with Warlock as the primary class. Rage restricts your spellcasting.
                    There
                    are some options that work, but other classes have better ones.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Bard</summary>
                <p>
                    Another Charisma based caster. Plus, Expertise and Jack of All Trades are only 2 levels in. A decent
                    dip
                    if you want to pick up some out-of-combat utility and more spell slots to work with.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Cleric</summary>
                <p>
                    Fun roleplay, tricky combat. Life Cleric and Celestial Warlock can mesh fair enough, if you want to
                    try
                    this combo.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Druid</summary>
                <p>
                    Just take Circle of the Land or Eldritch Adept.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Fighter</summary>
                <p>
                    Some great options if you pick up Fighter first. Constitution saving throw proficiency, heavy armor
                    and
                    shields, and a Fighting Style work very well with Hexblade and Pact of the Blade.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Monk</summary>
                <p>
                    Monk's abilities can synergize well with Hex, Hexblade's Curse, and it won't interfere with your
                    spellcasting. Both classes regain essential features on a short rest. Some higher levels can begin
                    to
                    fall off, though.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Paladin</summary>
                <p>
                    A classic combination. Hexblade Warlock and Pact of the Blade combine with Paladin's proficiencies
                    to
                    make a very straightforward Charisma based martial. Hexblade's Curse gives you more raw damage, and
                    recovering slots on a short rest gives you high level slots to funnel right into your Divine Smite.
                    While not as powerful now that 2024's ruleset only applies the max spell level to Warlock slots,
                    it's
                    still a great multiclass.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <smmary>Ranger</smmary>
                <p>
                    There is potential here, but it does require a specific goal in mind. Darkness and Devil's Sight can
                    synergize well with Gloom Stalker Ranger, and a lot of Ranger's spells don't really need WIS. It has
                    its
                    niche, if you're set on the combo.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Rogue</summary>
                <p>
                    A personal favorite, especially if you're good and talking your DM into interpreting things certain
                    ways. Take Assassin Rogue and Hexblade Warlock. If you so desire, maybe even Changeling. Take
                    Devil's
                    Sight and Armor of Shadows as your first invocations. This is a situation where the power of Devil's
                    Sight truly shines, as essentially the only other way to be able to see in magical darkness is
                    Truesight. You get Advantage for free since you can cast Darkness through Warlock, and if you
                    convince
                    your DM you can argue that being unable to see anything counts as being Surprised, so you always
                    crit
                    because of Assassinate.
                </p>

            <details>
                <summary>Sorcerer</summary>
                <p>
                    Your DM will hate you. An infamous multiclass for one specific reason: a strategy dubbed CoffeeLock.
                    Luckily, this was worked around in the 2024 ruleset, but previously there was a loophole which
                    allowed
                    you to farm sorcery points limitlessly. Still a powerful combination today, as you still regain your
                    Warlock spells on a short rest, which you can funnel into sorcery points for incredible longevity
                    and
                    versatility.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Wizard</summary>
                <p>
                    There are two options to consider here. On the primarily Wizard end of things. with 10 Wizard and 2
                    Warlock, combining Empowered Invocation and Agonizing Blast can allow you to add both INT and CHA to
                    every Eldritch Blast beam for amazing DpR. Alternatively, you can combine Arcane Ward with Armor of
                    Shadows to gain incredible survivability, and if you pick up Armor of Agathys it can just get silly.
                </p>
            </details>
            <h2>Closing Notes</h2>
            <p>
                While it can't combine with everything, Warlock serves well to add powerful options to the classes it
                will work with.
