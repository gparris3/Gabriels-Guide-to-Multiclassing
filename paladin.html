    <h2>Notable Features</h2>
    <h3>Divine Smite</h3>
    <p>
        With the 2024 ruleset, a Bonus Action to make your next attack deal a healthy amount of damage, turning high level spell slots into very effective bricks of dps. In 2014 this was even stronger, simply being a choice to add onto the attack.
    </p>
    <h2>Possible Combinations</h2>
    <details>
        <summary>Barbarian</summary>
        <p>
            Beg to let your DM use the 2014 version of Paladin. Divine Smite isn't a spell there. Otherwise, a lot of synergies that never were.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Bard</summary>
        <p>
            Higher level spell slots for use on Divine Smite, extra slots for your lower level spells, and Find Steed for excellent maneuverability (which can very well be abused with spells like Armor of Agathys). A good combo that doesn't push your ability scores too far.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Cleric</summary>
        <p>
            It can work, with Paladin offering Divine Smite and Cleric offering better spell progression, but juggling 4 ability scores will often ruin the build's effectiveness.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Druid</summary>
        <p>
            Divine Smite and Fighting Styles are a good option for Circle of Spores and maybe Moon, and auras work while in Wild Shape. However, getting these puts you far behind on Wild Shape, and likely won't be worth it.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Fighter</summary>
        <p>
            Champion Fighter can let you score a critical hit on a 19 or 18. This critical hit applies to your smites. If you're using the 2014 version of Paladin (which I do, since I heavily disagree with making Divine Smite a spell), then it's even nastier, as you can choose to smite whenever you want. You can save your smites for when you do land that crit, or even do it on reaction if you chose to take Battle Master and Riposte instead.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Monk</summary>
        <p>
            No smite on unarmed strikes, no armor, and 4 scores to juggle. Not worth.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Ranger</summary>
        <p>
            Two half-casters unfortunately do not make a full martial and full caster. Prerequisites spread your stats thin, but if you make it past those then their subclasses can synergize well, and both of their targeting features can combine for a powerful melee turn.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Rogue</summary>
        <p>
            In theory, a critical hit that will tear your foes asunder singlehandedly. In practice, a Paladin that doesn't get decent armor or hit dice above d8.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Sorcerer</summary>
        <p>
            Even just a single level will get you cantrips and plenty of spell slots to funnel into your smites. Draconic Bloodline can even get you a Dexterity-based build through Draconic Resilience. Metamagic can complement some Paladin spells well, but most slots will likely funnel into smiting. This is a rare case of smites changing to a spell benefits, as you can use Metamagic on your smites now (if it's worth the cost in More Smites).
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Warlock</summary>
        <p>
            A classic combination. Hexblade Warlock and Pact of the Blade combine with Paladin's proficiencies to make a very straightforward Charisma based martial. Hexblade's Curse gives you more raw damage, and recovering slots on a short rest gives you high level slots to funnel right into your Divine Smite.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Wizard</summary>
        <p>
            While sorcerer is much better, it can hold its own. As usual with Paladin, you end up juggling a lot of scores.
        </p>
