    <h2>Notable Features</h2>
    <h3>Action Surge</h3>
    <p>
        Fighter's trademark ability. Being able to take two actions in one turn is incredible for any class, and you only need to dip 2 levels into fighter to reach it. An amazing tool that can compliment just about any build. It should be noted that this does not override the restriction on leveled spells (only one per turn).
    </p>
    <h3>Extra Attack</h3>
    <p>
        Hit something two times instead of one time. Unfortunately, it does not stack with other classes' extra attack abilities. However, on classes that don't get it, it can either double their melee output or effectively give every attack advantage.
    </p>
    <h2>Possible Combinations</h2>
    <details>
        <summary>Barbarian</summary>
        <p>
            Another martial class. You get Rage at first level, and Reckless Attack at second level. Combined with the Champion subclass, being able to attack several times in a round, with advantage, and getting a critical hit on 19 (or even 18 at higher levels) works wonders to push out massive damage. You don't have to worry too much about ability scores, as both classes focus on the physical half. You miss out on Heavy armor, but Unarmored Defense can make up for it once you pump up your ability scores enough.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Bard</summary>
        <p>
            Multiclassing into Bard here is very dependent on subclasses. Inspiration is nice and so is Spellcasting, but it doesn't give you too much direct combat tools. Unless you take College of Swords, of course. Their flourishes can mesh very nicely with Battle Master's maneuvers, ensuring that you never run out of options. They can stack, as well, so if you use two similar features in tandem you can get good returns on your use. If you take Bard past 5th level you may start to see diminishing returns, however.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Cleric</summary>
        <p>
            "We have Paladin at home," they said. War domain compliments Fighter well, though there are some feature overlaps. Even so, you can make weapon attacks as a Bonus Action and give yourself a +10 to hit bonus. Combined with Action Surge and a few extra attacks, you're all but guaranteed to hit.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Druid</summary>
        <p>
            Champion fighter can work well here, as the extended crit range applies to natural weapons. Dreams druid and Echo Knight fighter could also mesh well on the lore side of things: a manifestation of your dream self.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Monk</summary>
        <p>
            A very difficult combination. On paper it can seem tempting for Extra Attack, Second Wind and Fighting Styles, but in practice the dexterity half of Fighter doesn't work properly with Monk. You're restricted from armor and most weapons, making your Fighter proficiencies useless. It can be a menace at early levels though, as the Unarmed Fighting Style gets you a very early d8 unarmed strike, normally only accessible at 11th level Monk.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Paladin</summary>
        <p>
            Champion Fighter can let you score a critical hit on a 19 or 18. This critical hit applies to your smites. If you're using the 2014 version of Paladin (which I do, since I heavily disagree with making Divine Smite a spell), then it's even nastier, as you can choose to smite whenever you want. You can save your smites for when you do land that crit, or even do it on reaction if you chose to take Battle Master and Riposte instead.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Ranger</summary>
        <p>
            An extra Fighting Style and a tiny bit of spellcasting. Some features do end up redundant, but a small dip of 1 or 2 levels could be argued for.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Rogue</summary>
        <p>
            If you choose Swashbuckler and Battle Master, this can get absurd very quickly. If you're the only person within 5 feet of an enemy, you get two chances at sneak attack. Then you can Action Surge and hold that action for the next turn. See, Sneak Attack's restriction is on turns, not rounds. So then that attack also gets an extra handful of d6. And then you can use Riposte. Oh, would you look at that! A new turn! I wonder how this one ends!
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Sorcerer</summary>
        <p>
            A decent dip for Fighters. Some of Sorcerer's big features come early on, and Action Surge makes Quickened Spell redundant to take other metamagic options. Or take it anyway, maybe even dipping Warlock as well for Eldritch Blast to <i>really</i> get silly.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Warlock</summary>
        <p>
            Hexblade Warlock works very well here. Hex Warrior and Pact of the Blade allow you to use Charisma for your attack and damage rolls, leaving you with one less stat to worry about juggling (as long as you have the 13 STR required to multiclass with Fighter). Eldritch Blast and Invocations are also strong options outright.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Wizard</summary>
        <p>
            A subclass dependent multiclass. As usual, a Fighter dip for Action Surge and some proficiencies is strong, but for Eldritch Knight it can allow yourself some more leeway in your spellcasting, as well as subclass bonuses from Wizard to make it stronger.
        </p>
    </details>
    <h2>Closing Notes</h2>
    <p>
        Fighter is an easy option for players who want to add some simple martial capability into their builds. Sometimes, however, it ends at that, not pushing too far to become a truly great option. A versatile class with versatile multiclassing.
