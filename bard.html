            <h2>Notable Features</h2>
            <h3>Bardic Inspiration</h3>
            <p>
                Depending on your level, give a creature (including yourself) an extra die to use on a roll of their
                choosing.
            </p>
            <h3>Jack Of All Trades</h3>
            <p>
                If you aren't proficient in a skill, you can add half of your proficiency bonus anyway.
            </p>
            <h3>Expertise</h3>
            <p>
                If you are proficient in a skill, you add your proficiency bonus twice.
            </p>
            <h2>Possible Combinations</h2>
            <details>
                <summary>Barbarian</summary>
                <p>
                    An effective all-rounder, supplementing Barbarian's hyperfocus on combat with Bard's everything
                    else. Alternatively, if you can plan ahead, advantage on your rolls and disadvantage on your
                    enemies' can lead to very effective grappling.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Cleric</summary>
                <p>
                    Doubles down on support, but you have to juggle both WIS and CHA. Lore Bard can use Magical Secrets
                    to get spells that Life Cleric wouldn't normally be able to access like Healing Spirit and apply its
                    healing buff to those as well.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Druid</summary>
                <p>
                    Buffs and summons and battlefield control, all in a single character. Like Cleric, you need to
                    juggle WIS and CHA, but it can work well with some planning.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Fighter</summary>
                <p>
                    Rough with a makeup of primarily Bard, but as always Action Surge is nice to have. College of Swords
                    can work well, as its flourishes mesh with Battle Master's maneuvers to have several options in
                    combat.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Monk</summary>
                <p>
                    Works surprisingly well. Way of the Drunken Master's text description often uses dancers and
                    performers alongside drunkards, so its flavoring can easily be narrowed down. This already matches
                    Bard, and things like College of Swords can push this further as their martial and melee weapons can
                    be used as a spellcasting focus, and their maneuvers can compliment Monk's dip in, dip out nature.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Paladin</summary>
                <p>
                    Higher level spell slots for use on Divine Smite, extra slots for your lower level spells, and Find
                    Steed for excellent maneuverability (which can very well be abused with spells like Armor of
                    Agathys). A good combo that doesn't push your ability scores too far.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Ranger</summary>
                <p>
                    No real synnergies here. Lots of utility, I suppose.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Rogue</summary>
                <p>
                    Between more proficiencies, more expertise, Jack of All Trades, and Reliable Talent... If you've
                    failed any skill check the DM is spiting you. Great 1 level dip, if you'll ever need that many skill
                    checks.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Sorcerer</summary>
                <p>
                    A good choice to pump up your spellcasting. No alternating ability scores, so a simple choice if you
                    want a more active role in combat.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Warlock</summary>
                <p>
                    Great combination, more proficiencies, and Hexblade is always nice. Use Charisma for melee attacks
                    and gain access to the ever-useful Eldritch Blast. Medium armor and shields also boost your
                    survivability, while making it so you'll never need more than 14 DEX.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Wizard</summary>
                <p>
                    Tempting, but Sorcerer is better. Dependent on another ability score, so stretches you thin. Ask
                    yourself if you can't get what you want out of this by taking Magic Initiate as a feat.
                </p>
            </details>
            <h2>Closing Notes</h2>
            <p>
                Excels when it's able to support itself. Drops off if you have to use more ability scores, but a lot of
                casting uses Charisma anyway, so stays relevant. Excellent to pick up more skills. If you can plan
                ahead, you can easily pull the strings of the entire combat, fitting for a leader.
