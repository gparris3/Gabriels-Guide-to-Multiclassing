            <h2>Notable Features</h2>
            <h3>Spellcasting</h3>
            <p>
                Wizards are essentially <i>the</i> spellcaster, with a wide range of spells to choose from (including
                the very tempting Fireball) and the spell slots to use them.
            </p>
            <h3>Ritual Adept</h3>
            <p>
                Rituals can be powerful spells, and while they take a while to cast, Wizards allow for the use of any
                spell with the Ritual tag without using a spellslot and without having it prepared, saving those for
                more in-the-moment abilities, such as 8d6 fire damage in a 20ft radius. No, you do <i>not</i> care how
                small the room is.
            </p>
            <h2>Possible Combinations</h2>
            <h3>Barbarian</h3>
            <p>
                Rage makes this combination utterly pointless. You're a full spellcaster with a feature that stops your
                spellcasting.
            </p>
            <h3>Bard</h3>
            <p>
                Jack of All Trades and some low-level spells that don't rely on CHA are a nice choice to pick up. It
                adds some more utility without needing to add them to your spellbook.
            </p>
            <h3>Cleric</h3>
            <p>
                Heavy armor proficiency, and some first-level spells and cantrips to round out your casting. One level
                of Cleric is a solid dip choice.
            </p>
            <h3>Druid</h3>
            <p>
                It's an extra ability score to juggle, but Wild Shape can give you some melee combat options to work
                with for only 2 levels.
            </p>
            <h3>Fighter</h3>
            <p>
                A subclass dependent multiclass. As usual, a Fighter dip for Action Surge and some proficiencies is
                strong, but for Eldritch Knight it can allow yourself some more leeway in your spellcasting, as well as
                subclass bonuses from Wizard to make it stronger.
            </p>
            <h3>Monk</h3>
            <p>
                No synergy. Wizard doesn't offer anything to Monk's martial arts, and Monk hampers Wizard's
                spellcasting.
            </p>
            <h3>Paladin</h3>
            <p>
                Can do well if you focus on Constitution to have great concentration while buffing yourself, but don't
                expect anything too crazy outside of it. If you're set on Paladin, Sorcerer is a better option.
            </p>
            <h3>Ranger</h3>
            <p>
                No real synergy. Splits ability scores for less return than it's worth.
            </p>
            <h3>Rogue</h3>
            <p>
                Bladesinger wizard combos well for extra AC and spellcasting. If you're feeling funny, use Find Familiar
                and have it use the Help action for free Advantage whenever you choose.
            </p>
            <h3>Sorcerer</h3>
            <p>
                Tempting, but redundant. The different stats diminish effectiveness for too similar of features. A dip
                can be argued for, but there's a certain point of similarity where you just stick with the first class.
            </p>
            <h3>Warlock</h3>
            <p>
                There are two options to consider here. On the primarily Wizard end of things. with 10 Wizard and 2
                Warlock, combining Empowered Invocation and Agonizing Blast can allow you to add both INT and CHA to
                every Eldritch Blast beam for amazing DpR. Alternatively, you can combine Arcane Ward with Armor of
                Shadows to gain incredible survivability, and if you pick up Armor of Agathys it can just get silly.
            </p>
            <h2>Closing Notes</h2>
            <p>
                There are some options that end up redundant, but it's more than plausible where it does fit. Most
                combinations do better with Wizard as the dip instead of the primary focus, as the focus on spellcasting
                Wizard forces gets disrupted by most classes.
